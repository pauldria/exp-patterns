# Experimentation Patterns

This repo explains the ins and outs of A/B experimentation through numerous **patterns** of good and bad. The main intention here is to match every experience that occurs via A/B experimentation via one of these patterns to help practitioners understand the potentially subtle nuances of good, bad, trustworthy, and untrustworthy experimentation.

This work is a culmination of years cutting my teeth in experimentation platforms, first at [Microsoft](https://www.exp-platform.com) and now at Reddit. 

| Pattern # | Description | Good Pattern or Bad Pattern? |
